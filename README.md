# Aim: 
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

# AI Tools Required:

* ChatGPT (LLM): For generating contextual and human-like responses.

* Python / Google Colab / CLI: To implement and simulate prompt-based interactions.

* Prompt Engineering Methods: To create adaptive and structured queries for efficient communication with the AI.

# Optional Integrations:

* Google Calendar API / Task Scheduler – for event automation.

* Notion / To-Do List API – for dynamic task synchronization.

## Overview:

This experiment focuses on building a Prompt-Oriented Personal Productivity Bot (PPPB) — an AI-powered virtual companion designed to assist with daily tasks, reminders, wellness activities, and learning support.
Unlike conventional applications relying on predefined buttons or commands, this assistant operates entirely through conversational prompts, showing how large language models (LLMs) can mimic natural human understanding, empathy, and adaptive learning.

The system encourages students to explore how AI can transform everyday productivity and personalization using prompt engineering techniques.

## Prompt Used:

“Create a personal digital assistant capable of managing daily schedules, providing wellness guidance, sending reminders, and answering queries naturally. The assistant should adapt to user preferences and improve interaction quality over time.”

## Procedure:
# Step 1 – Identify Main Capabilities

* The AI assistant should perform the following key roles:

* Manage and track user tasks efficiently.

* Organize events and set reminders.

* Provide motivational and health-related tips.

* Respond to general or academic inquiries.

* Gradually adapt to user interaction style and preferences.

## Step 2 – Develop Prompts for Each Module

| **Functionality** | **Sample Prompt**                              | **AI Response Behavior**                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Task Handling     | “Note down to finish my presentation by 4 PM.” | Saves and prioritizes the task with time. |
| Reminder          | “Alert me about my online lecture at 9 AM.”    | Sets and confirms a timed reminder.       |
| Wellness          | “Share a quick health tip for the day.”        | Gives personalized wellness advice.       |
| Knowledge Query   | “What is Ohm’s Law in electronics?”            | Explains clearly with examples.           |
| Personalization   | “Give shorter replies next time.”              | Adjusts response length as requested.     |


## Step 3 – Interactive Simulation Example
~~~
User: What do I need to complete today?
Assistant: You have three tasks — prepare your seminar slides, attend the AI workshop, and complete your assignment.
User: Please remind me to drink water every hour.
Assistant: Sure! Hydration reminders are now scheduled every hour.
~~~

## Step 4 – Simulating Personalized Learning

The assistant mimics adaptive memory by tracking user preferences.

* Example: If the user frequently requests “motivational content,” the assistant automatically includes it each morning.

* Basic personalization can be implemented using stored variables or a JSON file system.

## Step 5 – Optional Advanced Features

* Integrate with Google Calendar or Notion for real-time scheduling.

* Add voice output using libraries like pyttsx3.

* Create a basic GUI chatbot interface for visual interaction.

## Example Conversation Output:

User: “Set a reminder to finish my mini project by tonight.”
Assistant: “Noted! I’ve added a reminder for your mini project at 8 PM tonight.”

User: “Share a quick wellness tip.”
Assistant: “Take short breaks every hour and stretch to improve focus and energy.”

User: “I want a daily motivational quote in the morning.”
Assistant: “Absolutely! Here’s today’s quote: ‘Don’t watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going!’ ⏰💪”


## Unique Enhancements:

Emotion-Sensitive Responses: Detects user mood and replies accordingly.

Focus Mode: Blocks irrelevant tasks during study sessions.

Smart Study Assistant: Suggests productivity challenges or quick focus timers.

Context Retention: Learns language, tone, and preferred topics for consistent engagement.

## Result:

* The experiment successfully conceptualized a personalized AI-based assistant driven by prompts.

## Key learning outcomes include:

* Understanding how to construct effective prompts for targeted AI responses.

* Encouraging innovation through real-world personalization features.

* Practicing the fundamentals of prompt engineering and adaptive AI interaction.

* Recognizing how generative AI can improve daily productivity and time management.

## Conclusion:

This lab demonstrated that prompt engineering enables the creation of advanced, context-aware assistants using LLMs.
By transforming simple text prompts into meaningful, adaptive actions, students gained insight into how AI can emulate intelligent personal assistants that evolve based on user interaction.
The project showcases the future of digital assistance — where technology learns, adapts, and collaborates seamlessly with human users.
